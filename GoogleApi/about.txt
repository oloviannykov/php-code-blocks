Calendar, Docs and Chat API integrations need installation of PHP Composer and Google API client using Composer.
Installation of the Google Client Library: composer require google/apiclient:^2.0 
Credentials are saved in file GoogleCalendarCredentials. It must be replaced when account is changed.

* GoogleCalendarApi.php
Uses Google calendar API. 
Module can add, list and remove events. 

* GoogleDocsApi.php
Uses Google Docs API.
Reports can be exported to Google Docs and shared with another account using email address. Docs will be created on separated subaccount, so you will not see it if you
simply login to Google Docs. So sharing is needed to view the file anyway.
